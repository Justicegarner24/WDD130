    <p>Hi everyone! I am so so excited to be in this class with y'all!
    I am majoring in Computer Information Technology, with a minor in Web 
    Development and a cluster in Draphic Design. Im not sure of what I want 
    to do in this career path yet, but ive made it so that i have lots of 
    different options!</p>
    <p>I have so many different hoddies! Most of them include creating something. 
    I love to craft! whether its crochet, paiting, drawing, writing, I just love
    all of it!</p>
    <p>I am not currently married or dating anyone as i would just like to focus on 
    school.</p>
    <p>I currently work full time as a cutodian at a high school. I will work 
    here until this coming January, which feels like a lifetime away, then I 
    plan to move to Rexburg for school!</p>
    <p>Honestly the thing I love most about BYUI is how cheap it is, it makes 
    it so that you can go to school and finish without any debt! I am pursuing a BS in CIT</p>
    <p>I am taking this class as part of my minor and so far I'm thinking web design would be 
    such a fun career to pursue! its already a lot of fun! Before graduating I would like to 
    use the knowledge I gain from this course to build a website for an online shop. I currently 
    have a small sticker shop on Etsy, and for those of you who dont know they take a lot of fees 
    when you make a sale. So my goal is to make my own shop website so that I dont have to deal with the fees!</p>
    <p>I have been a member since I was 9 years old and i am currently 23, so i am technically a convert. 
    I served my mission in South Florida and I absolutely loved it! My favorite scripture actually comes 
    from my time in the field, it 3rd Nephi 5:13 which reads: "Behold, I am a disciple of Jesus Christ, 
    the Son of God. I have been called of him to declare his word among his people, that they might 
    have everlasting life."</p>
