                        <h3>Here are four mental beneifts of crocheting</h3>
                        <h3>1. Relieves stress
                            Crochet relieves stress in the comfort of your own space. After a long and stressful day, you can count on crochet to ease your stress and wind down.
                            The repetitive motion involved in crochet decreases stress hormones and enables the secretion of feel-good hormones, serotonin and dopamine. Many scientists also believe that the repetitive and rhythmic movements involved in crochet activate the same areas in the brain as meditation and yoga do. Crochet can add a sense of balance to the stress of a high-tech, fast-paced lifestyle.
                        </h3>
                        <h3>2. Calms anxiety and eases depression.
                            Crochet has a calming effect and is useful in treating insomnia, anxiety, and depression. According to a study done by researchers at the University of Wollongong Australia, crocheting can improve major mental health benefits, including improved focus and memory, and relief from depression and anxiety. 
                            Many people have also stated that crochet has helped them handle and overcome grief and few have even felt happier after starting to crochet. Crochet is also useful in the treatment of asthma, and panic attacks. Also, repetitive movements have also been effective in the management of disruptive behavior and ADHD in children.
                        </h3>
                        <h3>3. Reduces the risks of Alzheimer’s
                            The American Counselling Association found that crocheting can help those aging who may struggle with dementia and obsessive-compulsive disorder. With crochet, there is always something new to learn and develop. Besides, the coordinated movement of hands and eyes develops a new neural network that renders some sort of neuroprotection.
                        </h3>
                        <h3>4. Helps with self-esteem
                            How would you feel about something you made yourself? Wouldn’t you pride yourself over it? This is what crochet does, it gives you a sense of self-accomplishment making you realize how worthy and capable you are.
                            Oftentimes, we need something to remind us of our worth. And crochet does exactly that. Besides, you can also donate your projects to charity and that provides a sense of purpose. Heavenly isn’t it?
