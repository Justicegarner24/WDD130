      <h3>Stitches</h3>
      <p>
        Holding yarn, hook (one picture)
        Everyone crochets in a way that makes them comfortable. If that means holding your yarn from over your shoulder or under your pinky then that’s just how you’ll do it. That being said there’s no specific way for anyone to hold their yarn, but in the photo example is the basic way many people like to hold it. As for the Hook, many people hold it like a pencil or some hold it like the photo here, but same with the yarn, just hold it in a way that doesn’t make you uncomfortable or sore.
      </p>
      <p>
        Slipknot (one picture)
        There are some different methods to get your beginning slipknot, but it's all the same process. Be sure to keep in mind if you are a knitter where often a slipknot counts as a stitch, in crochet that isn’t the case. The slipknot is just starting off your work. Refer to the photo to know how to make the slipknot.
      </p>
      <p>
        Chain (ch) (one photo)
        Chain is the simplest of the stitches, and oftentimes how you will start off many of your projects. As shown in the photo, you will wrap the yarn around your hoop and pull it right through the first loop that was previously on your hook. And that’s it! You’ve got your first chain, oftentimes, a project will tell you right from the beginning to chain a certain amount then you’ll move right on to the second round of your project.
      </p>
      <p>
        Single crochet (sc)
        Single crochet is just one more additional step to the chain. From our wonderful picture here we can see that you will insert your hook into the two loops at the top of the stitch and yarn over, pull the loop through and you will have two loops on your hook, you will then yarn over again, and pull that loop through both the loops on your hook and your finished!! With single crochet there are two variations, yarn over, the basic most used stitch, and yarn UNDER, a lesser known variation. It’s often called an X stitch, because when it's complete it looks like an ‘X’ it gives you nice straight even stitches, this is why it is often used to make stuffed animals!
      </p>
      <p>
        Slip stitch (sl st)
        Slip stitches aren't used too often, mostly to join rounds of crochet together to make them more even. As this picture shows, you will insert the hook into a stitch, yarn over  and immediately pull it through the first loop on the hook.
      </p>
      <p>
        Double crochet (dc)
        Now here is where things get a bit more complicated, double crochet is a very common stitch used in blankets and many other kinds of projects. Make sure to pay close attention to the photo for this one, you will start by yarning over and  insert the hook into a stitch, yarn over the hook, pull the yarn through the stitch. You should have three loops on your hook.  Yarn over and pull through two loops on your hook, yarn over and pull through the last two loops on hook. And you're done!
      </p>
      <p>
        Half double crochet (hdc)
        Half double crochet is basically double crochet, minus a step. You'll yarn over, insert the hook into the stitch, pull up a loop and pull through all the loops on your hook.

      <h3>Benefits</h3>
      <p>
        Crochet has been found to benefit people in many different ways, it's not just a hobby but it's also a medicine! Thats what makes crochet so special
      </p>
      <h1>
        Here are four mental beneifts of crocheting
      </h1>
      <p>
        1. Relieves stress
        Crochet relieves stress in the comfort of your own space. After a long and stressful day, you can count on crochet to ease your stress and wind down.
        The repetitive motion involved in crochet decreases stress hormones and enables the secretion of feel-good hormones, serotonin and dopamine. Many scientists also believe that the repetitive and rhythmic movements involved in crochet activate the same areas in the brain as meditation and yoga do. Crochet can add a sense of balance to the stress of a high-tech, fast-paced lifestyle.
        2. Calms anxiety and eases depression.
        Crochet has a calming effect and is useful in treating insomnia, anxiety, and depression. According to a study done by researchers at the University of Wollongong Australia, crocheting can improve major mental health benefits, including improved focus and memory, and relief from depression and anxiety. 
        Many people have also stated that crochet has helped them handle and overcome grief and few have even felt happier after starting to crochet. Crochet is also useful in the treatment of asthma, and panic attacks. Also, repetitive movements have also been effective in the management of disruptive behavior and ADHD in children.
        3. Reduces the risks of Alzheimer’s
        The American Counselling Association found that crocheting can help those aging who may struggle with dementia and obsessive-compulsive disorder. With crochet, there is always something new to learn and develop. Besides, the coordinated movement of hands and eyes develops a new neural network that renders some sort of neuroprotection.
        4. Helps with self-esteem
        How would you feel about something you made yourself? Wouldn’t you pride yourself over it? This is what crochet does, it gives you a sense of self-accomplishment making you realize how worthy and capable you are.
        Oftentimes, we need something to remind us of our worth. And crochet does exactly that. Besides, you can also donate your projects to charity and that provides a sense of purpose. Heavenly isn’t it?
      </p>
      <h1>
        Here are three physical benefits of crochet
      </h1>
      <p>
        1. Crocheting can improve fine motor skills and hand-eye coordination.
        2.Crocheting can also provide a low-impact form of exercise for the muscles in your hands, wrists, and arms.
        3.Crocheting can even improve sleep. The relaxation that comes from crocheting can help to calm the mind and prepare the body for sleep.
